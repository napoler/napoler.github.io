## Resource Limits[¶](https://www.uvicorn.org/settings/#resource-limits "Permanent link")

-   `--limit-concurrency <int>` - Maximum number of concurrent connections or tasks to allow, before issuing HTTP 503 responses. Useful for ensuring known memory usage patterns even under over-resourced loads.
-   `--limit-max-requests <int>` - Maximum number of requests to service before terminating the process. Useful when running together with a process manager, for preventing memory leaks from impacting long-running processes.
-   `--backlog <int>` - Maximum number of connections to hold in backlog. Relevant for heavy incoming traffic. **Default:** _2048_
