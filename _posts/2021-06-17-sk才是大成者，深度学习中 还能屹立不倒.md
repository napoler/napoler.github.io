sk才是大成者，深度学习中 还能屹立不倒

#sklearn #保存模型

What you are looking for is called **Model persistence** in sklearn words and it is documented in [introduction](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html#model-persistence) and in [model persistence](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_persistence.html) sections.

So you have initialized your classifier and trained it for a long time with

```
clf = some.classifier()
clf.fit(X, y)
```

After this you have two options:

**1) Using Pickle**

```
import pickle
# now you can save it to a file
with open('filename.pkl', 'wb') as f:
    pickle.dump(clf, f)

# and later you can load it
with open('filename.pkl', 'rb') as f:
    clf = pickle.load(f)
```

**2) Using Joblib**
/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/sklearn/externals/joblib/\_\_init\_\_.py:15: FutureWarning: sklearn.externals.joblib is deprecated in 0.21 and will be removed in 0.23. Please import this functionality directly from joblib, which can be installed with: pip install joblib. If this warning is raised when loading pickled models, you may need to re-serialize those models with scikit-learn 0.21+. warnings.warn(msg, category=FutureWarning)

还是pickle吧，那个更加通用，无恼用就可以。
```
from sklearn.externals import joblib
# now you can save it to a file
joblib.dump(clf, 'filename.pkl') 
# and later you can load it
clf = joblib.load('filename.pkl')
```
